# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Thus, I employed different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I use  RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids algorithm and SMOTEENN algorithm. I used two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
